# Backend Coding Challenge

## Requirements

Design a REST API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities.

- The endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- The partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
- The caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- The endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
  - The suggestions are sorted by descending score
  - Each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
  - Each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
  - Each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
- Feel free to add more features if you like!

## "The rules"

- _Use the language and technology of your choosing_ It's OK to try something new (tell us if you do), but try to use something you're comfortable with. We don't care if you use something we don't; the goal here isn't to validate your knowledge of a particular technology.
- End result should be deployed on a public Cloud (Heroku, AWS etc. all have free tiers you can use). For some reason, if you're unable to do this,
  please give us instructions for running your solution.

## Dataset

You can find the necessary dataset along with its description and documentation in the [`data`](data/) directory.

## Advice

- **Try to design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code**. Show us how you create clean, maintainable code. Build something we'd be happy to contribute to. This is not a programming contest where dirty hacks win the game.
- We donâ€™t want to know if you can do exactly as asked (or everybody would have the same result). We want to know what **you** bring to the table when working on a project, what is your secret sauce. More features? Best solution? Thinking outside the box?

## Sample responses

Responses are meant to provide guidance. The exact values can vary based on the data source and scoring algorithm

**Near match**

    GET /suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "London, ON, Canada",
      "latitude": "42.98339",
      "longitude": "-81.23304",
      "score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "name": "London, OH, USA",
      "latitude": "39.88645",
      "longitude": "-83.44825",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "London, KY, USA",
      "latitude": "37.12898",
      "longitude": "-84.08326",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "Londontowne, MD, USA",
      "latitude": "38.93345",
      "longitude": "-76.54941",
      "score": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
```

**No match**

    GET /suggestions?q=SomeRandomCityInTheMiddleOfNowhere

```json
{
  "suggestions": []
}
```
